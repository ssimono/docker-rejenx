Scaffholder project for Docker-Jekyll-Webpack-React-Nginx
======================================================

Inspired from the great [jekyll-webpack](https://github.com/allizad/jekyll-webpack) by [allizad](https://github.com/allizad). But dockerized, nginxed, development ready and deployment ready.

Development
-----------

Run: `docker-compose up`. Then browse http://localhost:4000/

What you get:

- A jekyll static website, with a base template and some inserted content.
- A jekyll development server that is serving the above upon `docker-compose up`

Deployment
----------
